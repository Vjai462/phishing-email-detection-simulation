# üêû Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Phase | Difficulty | Solution | Date | Status | Learning |
|---------|-------|------------|----------|------|--------|----------|
| Windows Server 2022 can't install .NET Framework 3.5 through Windows Features | Phase 1 | Medium | Use Server Manager **"Add roles and features"** or PowerShell `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature`. <br><br> **Alternative Solution (If Download Keeps Failing):** <br> Manual .NET Framework Download: <br>  **Actions:** <br> 1. Open a new browser tab <br> 2. Go to: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=1639) <br> 3. Download and install manually <br> 4. Return to hMailServer installation | Sept 6, 2025 | ‚úÖ Done | Legacy applications often need older frameworks installed as optional features. <br><br> **Why This Happened (Windows Server 2022):** <br> ‚Ä¢ Modern Windows Server comes with .NET Framework 4.x pre-installed <br> ‚Ä¢ Legacy .NET 2.0/3.5 must be added as an optional feature <br> ‚Ä¢ hMailServer was built for older .NET versions, so it requires legacy framework <br><br> **This is Normal:** Many older applications require legacy frameworks. |
| Forgotten Admin Account Password (Lost/forgot password for admin@Sber.local account, preventing Thunderbird login) | Phase 1 | Easy | Reset password directly in hMailServer Administrator by navigating to **Domains ‚Üí Sber.local ‚Üí Accounts ‚Üí admin@Sber.local**, clearing password field, entering new password (`admin123`), and clicking Save. After saving, password displays as `<<Encrypted>>` which confirms successful storage. | Sept 7, 2025 | ‚úÖ Done | Email server administrators can reset user passwords directly through the management interface. The `<<Encrypted>>` display after saving indicates proper password encryption and storage. Always use simple passwords in lab environments for easy testing, but remember to document them. |
| Thunderbird Cannot Connect to hMailServer (connection errors despite correct configuration) | Phase 1 | Medium | Multiple factors resolved: <br> 1. Changed hostname from `sber.local` ‚Üí `127.0.0.1` <br> 2. Verified hMailServer services were running (SMTP, IMAP, POP3) <br> 3. Used IP address instead of domain name | Sept 7, 2025 | ‚úÖ Done | In lab environments, using IP addresses (`127.0.0.1`) is more reliable than domain names because it bypasses DNS resolution. Always verify server services are running before troubleshooting. |
| Thunderbird rejected "sber.local" hostname with error *"Hostname empty or invalid. Only letters, numbers, - and . are allowed‚Äù* | Phase 1 | Medium | Replaced domain name `sber.local` with IP address `127.0.0.1` in Thunderbird configuration. This bypassed hostname validation. | Sept 7, 2025 | ‚úÖ Done | Email clients enforce strict hostname validation. In labs where domains aren‚Äôt registered in DNS, using `127.0.0.1` is the most reliable method. |
| `sudo nano config.json` opens an empty file | Phase 3 | Medium | The wrong file was downloaded (source code instead of pre-compiled binary). Solution: re-download the correct file, `gophish-vX.Y.Z-linux-64bit.zip`, which contains `config.json`. | Sept 7, 2025 | ‚úÖ Done | Always ensure you download the correct **binary executable** for your OS, not the source code. |
| `sudo ./gophish` returns *command not found* | Phase 3 | Medium | The file lacked execute permission. Solution: run `chmod +x gophish` to make it executable. | Sept 7, 2025 | ‚úÖ Done | In Linux, a file must have `x` (execute) permission to run as a program. This permission is often lost during unzipping. |
| Opening `http://0.0.0.0:80` shows Apache page instead of GoPhish | Phase 3 | Medium | Apache web server was already using port 80. Solution: stop Apache service to free the port. Note: GoPhish admin panel runs on port 3333 via HTTPS. | Sept 7, 2025 | ‚úÖ Done | Only one program can bind to a port at a time. If you get conflicts, check which service is already using the port. |
