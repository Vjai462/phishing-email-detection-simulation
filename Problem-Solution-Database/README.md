# üêû Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Phase | Difficulty | Solution | Date | Status | Learning |
|---------|-------|------------|----------|------|--------|----------|
| Windows Server 2022 can't install .NET Framework 3.5 through Windows Features | Phase 1 | Medium | Use Server Manager **"Add roles and features"** or PowerShell `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature`. <br><br> **Alternative Solution (If Download Keeps Failing):** <br> Manual .NET Framework Download: <br> üì∏ *Screenshot timing: before alternative* <br> - Screenshot of current error state <br> **Actions:** <br> 1. Open a new browser tab <br> 2. Go to: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=1639) <br> 3. Download and install manually <br> 4. Return to hMailServer installation | Sept 6, 2025 | ‚úÖ Done | Legacy applications often need older frameworks installed as optional features. <br><br> **Why This Happened (Windows Server 2022):** <br> ‚Ä¢ Modern Windows Server comes with .NET Framework 4.x pre-installed <br> ‚Ä¢ Legacy .NET 2.0/3.5 must be added as an optional feature <br> ‚Ä¢ hMailServer was built for older .NET versions, so it requires legacy framework <br><br> **This is Normal:** Many older applications require legacy frameworks. This is common in IT environments. |
| Forgotten Admin Account Password (Lost/forgot password for admin@Sber.local account, preventing Thunderbird login) | Phase 1 | Easy | Reset password directly in hMailServer Administrator by navigating to **Domains ‚Üí Sber.local ‚Üí Accounts ‚Üí admin@Sber.local**, clearing password field, entering new password (`admin123`), and clicking Save. After saving, password displays as `<<Encrypted>>` which confirms successful storage. | Sept 7, 2025 | ‚úÖ Done | Email server administrators can reset user passwords directly through the management interface. The `<<Encrypted>>` display after saving indicates proper password encryption and storage. Always use simple passwords in lab environments for easy testing, but remember to document them for future reference. |
| Thunderbird Cannot Connect to hMailServer (connection errors despite correct configuration) | Phase 1 | Medium | Multiple factors resolved: <br> 1. Changed hostname from `sber.local` ‚Üí `127.0.0.1` to avoid domain resolution issues <br> 2. Verified hMailServer services were running (SMTP, IMAP, POP3) <br> 3. Used IP address instead of domain name for reliable local connection | Sept 7, 2025 | ‚úÖ Done | In lab environments, using IP addresses (`127.0.0.1`) is more reliable than domain names because it bypasses DNS resolution issues. Always verify that server services are running before troubleshooting client connections. The **Status** section in hMailServer Administrator shows service states ‚Äî all should show "Started". |
| Thunderbird rejected "sber.local" hostname with error *"Hostname empty or invalid. Only letters, numbers, - and . are allowed‚Äù* | Phase 1 | Medium | Replaced domain name `sber.local` with IP address `127.0.0.1` in Thunderbird configuration. This bypassed hostname validation and connected directly to the local server. | Sept 7, 2025 | ‚úÖ Done | Email clients enforce strict hostname validation. In labs where custom domains aren‚Äôt registered in DNS, using `127.0.0.1` is the most reliable method. This highlights the difference between domain names (need DNS resolution) and IP addresses (direct connection). |
