The **“Phishing Email Detection System”** is a practical, end-to-end cybersecurity project designed to simulate and defend against one of the most common attack vectors—phishing. The project was built inside a secure virtual lab environment, allowing us to replicate real-world conditions while maintaining a controlled and ethical setting.

The core objective was twofold:

1. **Simulate a real phishing attack** to understand how attackers operate.
2. **Develop a detection mechanism** that can automatically identify malicious emails.

By doing this, the project bridges the gap between theory and practice, showcasing both red-team (attack simulation) and blue-team (defense and detection) perspectives.

## Problem Statement

Phishing continues to be the most widespread initial attack method, often leading to credential theft, malware infections, and large-scale breaches. Despite awareness training, phishing emails still trick users due to their evolving sophistication.

This project addresses that challenge by:

- Demonstrating how phishing campaigns are structured and delivered.
- Creating a detection tool that can identify phishing attempts before they reach the user.
- Providing hands-on exposure to the investigative process of tracking and analyzing attacks.

## Methodology

The project was executed in **eight structured phases**, ensuring both technical depth and clarity in documentation:

1. **Email Server Setup** – Built a local mail server to simulate real email communication.
2. **DNS Configuration** – Configured a private DNS to mirror realistic enterprise environments.
3. **GoPhish Deployment** – Used GoPhish to craft and launch controlled phishing emails.
4. **Wireshark Setup** – Captured and monitored live network traffic for forensic visibility.
5. **Attack Simulation** – Executed a phishing campaign, from delivery to credential capture.
6. **Analysis & Detection** – Investigated email headers and packet data to trace the attack.
7. **Python Script Development** – Built a lightweight ML-based script to classify phishing emails automatically.
8. **Documentation & Portfolio Creation** – Compiled technical findings, screenshots, and a demo report for portfolio use.

## Technologies and Skills Gained

Through this project, I worked across multiple domains, strengthening both technical and professional skills:

- **Cybersecurity Tools**: GoPhish, Wireshark, pfSense, and secure email server administration.
- **Networking**: Practical knowledge of SMTP, DNS, and TCP/IP traffic analysis.
- **Programming & ML**: Python scripting with scikit-learn for detection automation.
- **System Administration**: Hands-on experience with Kali Linux, Ubuntu, and Windows Server 2022.
- **Professional Skills**: Problem-solving, structured project execution, and professional documentation tailored for recruiters.

## Key Takeaway

This project highlights my ability to **simulate real cyber threats, build practical defense mechanisms, and document the entire lifecycle** in a way that mirrors professional SOC (Security Operations Center) workflows. It demonstrates not just technical know-how but also the mindset needed to investigate, defend, and innovate in cybersecurity.
