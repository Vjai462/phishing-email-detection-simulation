 ##What We're Learning


## Tools Needed

*List of software and tools for this phase*

- **hMailServer** - Our digital post office software (free and user-friendly)
- **Windows Server 2022 VM** - The building where our post office will operate
- **Your web browser** - To download hMailServer

ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Process
Step 1: Prepare Your Windows Server 2022 VM
### **Actions:**

1. **Start your Windows Server 2022 VM** in VirtualBox
2. **Wait for it to fully boot up** (you'll see the desktop)
3. **Open Internet Explorer or Edge browser**

### **ðŸ§  Learning Note:**
Windows Server is like a more powerful version of regular Windows, designed to run services (like our email server) for multiple users.

Step 2: Download hMailServer
### **Actions:**

1. **Navigate to:** https://www.hmailserver.com/download
2. **Look for the latest version** (should be something like "hMailServer 5.6.8")
3. **Click the download link** for the full installer (not the upgrade version)
4. **Choose "Save file"** when prompted
### **Learning Note:**

hMailServer is like building a complete post office. It can receive mail from the outside, sort it, store it in individual mailboxes, and let people check their mail.

Step 3: Install hMailServer
### **Actions:**

1. **Double-click the downloaded hMailServer installer**
2. **Click "Next"** through the welcome screen
3. **Accept the license agreement** and click "Next"
4. **Choose installation location** (default is fine) and click "Next"
5. **Select components** - leave everything checked and click "Next"
6. **Choose "Use built-in database engine"** (this is simpler for learning)
7. **Create administrator password** - write this down! Use something like: `AdminPass123`
8. **Click "Install"** and wait for completion

### **Learning Note:**

The "built-in database" is like having a filing cabinet built into our post office to store all the mailboxes and messages, rather than using a separate storage building.

## **Step 4: First Launch and Configuration**

### ðŸ“¸ **SCREENSHOT TIMING: Before**

- Screenshot of Windows desktop after installation

### **Actions:**

1. **Look for hMailServer Administrator** icon on desktop or Start menu
2. **Double-click to launch hMailServer Administrator**
3. **You'll see a connection dialog** - click "Connect" (it should connect to localhost automatically)
4. **Enter the administrator password** you created earlier
5. **Click OK**

### **Learning Note:**

The Administrator tool is like the post office manager's control panel - from here we can create mailboxes, set up rules, and manage our entire email system.

## **Step 5: Create Your Email Domain**

### **What's a Domain?**

Think of a domain like your company's address. Instead of @gmail.com or @yahoo.com, we'll create something like @ourcompany.local for our virtual company.

### ðŸ“¸ **SCREENSHOT TIMING: Before**

- Screenshot of empty hMailServer domains list

### **Actions:**

1. **In hMailServer Administrator, look for "Domains" in the left panel**
2. **Right-click on "Domains"** and select "New Domain"
3. **Enter domain name:** `ourcompany.local`
4. **Click "Save"**
5. **You should see your domain appear in the list**

## **Step 6: Create Email Accounts (Our First Mailboxes)**

### **We'll create 3 accounts:**

- [**admin@ourcompany.local**](mailto:admin@ourcompany.local) - The administrator
- [**victim@ourcompany.local**](mailto:victim@ourcompany.local) - Our phishing target
- [**attacker@ourcompany.local**](mailto:attacker@ourcompany.local) - Our simulated hacker
### **Actions for First Account:**

1. **Expand "ourcompany.local" in the left panel**
2. **Right-click on "Accounts"** and select "New Account"
3. **Enter Address:** `admin@ourcompany.local`
4. **Enter Password:** `AdminEmail123` (write this down!)
5. **Set Maximum size:** 100 MB (default is fine)
6. **Click "Save"**

### **Repeat for other accounts:**

- [**victim@ourcompany.local**](mailto:victim@ourcompany.local) with password: `VictimPass123`
- [**attacker@ourcompany.local**](mailto:attacker@ourcompany.local) with password: `AttackerPass123`

### **Learning Note:**

These accounts are like individual mailboxes in our post office. Each person gets their own secure mailbox that only they can access with their password.

âœ… Success Checkpoints
### **Test Steps:**

1. **In hMailServer Administrator, go to "Utilities" menu**
2. **Click "Send Test Message"**
3. **Fill in:**
    - From: `admin@ourcompany.local`
    - To: `victim@ourcompany.local`
    - Subject: `Test Email - Server Working!`
    - Message: `This is a test to confirm our email server is working correctly.`
4. **Click "Send"**

### **Check if it worked:**

1. **Go to "Domains" â†’ "ourcompany.local" â†’ "Accounts" â†’ "[victim@ourcompany.local](mailto:victim@ourcompany.local)"**
2. **Double-click the victim account**
3. **Look for "Messages" tab** - you should see 1 message!

## Key Concepts Learned

*Technical terms and concepts explained simply*

- **Email Server:** The computer program that handles email delivery
- **Domain:** Like a company address (e.g., @mycompany.com)
- **Email Account:** Individual mailboxes for users
- **SMTP:** The language email servers use to talk to each other (like postal codes)
- **POP3/IMAP:** Ways to check your email (like different ways to access your mailbox)

## Problems Encountered

*Issues faced and solutions found*

- **Problem:** Windows Server 2022 can't install .NET Framework 3.5 through Windows Features
- **Phase:** Phase 1
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Solution:** Use Server Manager "Add roles and features" or PowerShell Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature
- **Learning:** Legacy applications often need older frameworks installed as optional features

# **Learning Note - Why This Happened:**

### **Windows Server 2022 Behavior:**

- **Modern Windows Server** comes with .NET Framework 4.x pre-installed
- **Legacy .NET 2.0/3.5** needs to be added as an optional feature
- **hMailServer** was built for older .NET versions, so it needs the legacy framework

### **This is Normal:**

Many older applications require legacy frameworks. This is common in IT environments!
